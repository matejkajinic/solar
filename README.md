# 3D Solar System Animation

This project features a sophisticated SVG animation of a 3D-like solar system, created using AI assistance from Claude, an AI assistant developed by Anthropic.

## Project Description

The animation showcases a tilted view of our solar system, including:

- The Sun at the center with a pulsing animation
- Six planets (Mercury to Saturn) orbiting at different speeds
- An asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
- Realistic planet colors and gradients
- A starry background
- Labels for all celestial bodies

## Original Prompt

The original prompt used to generate this animation was:

```
"Create an SVG animation of a sophisticated 3D-like solar system.
Include:
1. A black background covering the entire viewport, filled with small white stars using radial gradients.
2. A tilted orbital plane to give a 3D perspective, represented by a subtle ellipse.
3. The sun at the center, represented by a white circle with a radial gradient and a subtle glow effect. Add a pulsing animation to the sun.
4. Six planets (Mercury to Saturn) orbiting the sun. Use white circles with radial gradients and subtle glow effects for all planets. Ensure planets complete full orbits at different speeds, with inner planets moving faster than outer ones.
5. Elliptical orbits for each planet, represented by thin, light gray lines.
6. An asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, shown as a dashed ellipse.
7. Saturn's ring as a thin, light ellipse around the planet.
8. Small, semi-transparent labels for the sun, each planet, and the asteroid belt.
9. A title '3D Orbital Plane' and a brief description about all planets orbiting on the same plane.
Use SVG animations for the planet orbits and sun pulsing. Aim for a cohesive, sophisticated look with all celestial bodies using similar white gradients and subtle glow effects. The overall aesthetic should be mature and visually appealing."

## About the AI Assistant (Claude)

This project was created with the assistance of Claude, an AI model developed by Anthropic. Here are some key details about Claude:

- Model Family: Claude 3
- Specific Version: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Knowledge Cutoff: April 2024
- Capabilities: Claude can assist with a wide range of tasks including analysis, question answering, math, coding, creative writing, and general discussion.
- Limitations: 
  - Cannot access external websites or databases
  - Cannot generate, produce, edit, manipulate or create images
  - May occasionally produce incorrect information or "hallucinate", especially for very obscure topics
- Ethical Considerations: Claude is designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest. It will not assist with illegal or harmful activities.

Please note that while Claude strives for accuracy, all outputs should be reviewed and verified by humans before use in any critical applications.
